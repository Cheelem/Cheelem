### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This is Lingen.

### ðŸ˜Š About Me
- ðŸ“· I'm currently working on research projects about **Computational Photography**. 
- âœ¨ I love designing beautiful things. I'm also willing to build opensource projects such as UI components library.
- ðŸ“– I'm also interested in East Asian foreign language learning (Japanese and Korean) and some topics of historical lingustics like Middle (Ancient) Chinese.

Seeking people with similar interests to build wonderful things together.
